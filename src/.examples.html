<h2>Examples</h2>
<p>See <a href='https://github.com/theSage21/staticsite/tree/master/examples'>examples folder</a> for code regarding these examples and more.</p>

<h3>Developing the site</h3>

<p>
<code>python -m staticsite watch</code> keeps re-rendering your site as soon as it detects changes.
</p>

<p>You can then use <code>{<span></span>% include '.autoreload.html' %}</code> in your site's base tempate, which will reload your site in the browser when the source files change.</p>
<p>If you build your site using <code>pyton -m staticsite build</code> then the auto reload part is not included, leaving you with a static site.</p>

<h3>Adding custom processors</h3>
You can add custom processors by adding them as key, value pairs in your staticsite yml file.

For example the example file contains pretty_json. which renders like:

{% set obj = {'a': {'b': {'c': {'d': 10}}}} %}
<pre>
{{ plugins.pretty_json(obj) }}
</pre>

<h3>Two way data binding</h3>

<p>
If we add two numbers X
<input data-value='x' />
and Y <input data-value='y' />
the result is <span data-text='total'></span> and the square of that is <span data-text='square'></span>.
</p>

<p>You can use minimal two way data binding along with flat computed dependencies as well! Makes code a lot easier to write.</p>
