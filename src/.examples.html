<p>See <a href='{{ baseurl }}/examples/index.html'>examples folder</a> for ways to do modern things with staticsite.</p>

<h3>Developing the site</h3>

<p>
<code>python -m staticsite watch</code> keeps re-rendering your site as soon as it detects changes.
</p>

<p>You can then use <code>{<span></span>% include '.autoreload.html' %}</code> in your site's base tempate, which will reload your site in the browser when the source files change.</p>
<p>If you build your site using <code>pyton -m staticsite build</code> then the auto reload part is not included, leaving you with a static site.</p>

<h3>Adding custom processors</h3>
You can add custom processors by adding them as key, value pairs in your staticsite yml file.

For example the example file contains pretty_json. which renders like:

{% set obj = {'a': {'b': {'c': {'d': 10}}}} %}
<pre>
{{ plugins.pretty_json(obj) }}
</pre>
