<h2>Developing the site</h2>
<p>
<code>python -m staticsite watch</code> keeps re-rendering your site as soon as it detects changes.
</p>

<p>You can then use <code>{<span></span>% include '.autoreload.html' %}</code> in your site's base tempate, which will reload your site in the browser when the source files change.</p>
<p>If you build your site using <code>pyton -m staticsite build</code> then the auto reload part is not included, leaving you with a static site.</p>
